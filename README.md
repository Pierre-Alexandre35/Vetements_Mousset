## Description
Created as an alternative to in-store purchasing during the pandemic. This is a basic storefont built in 48 hours for my parents' boutique. The platform is currently static and I am planning to improve the design + add a back-end system by the end of this summer.

## Roadmap
- Remove the cov-19 pop-up window 
- Build a back-system to let my parents add, remove or modify articles
